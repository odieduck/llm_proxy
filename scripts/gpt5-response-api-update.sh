echo "🚀 GPT-5 & Response API Update Deployed"

echo "✅ New Models Added:"
echo "  🔥 GPT-5 (Flagship model)"
echo "  ⚡ GPT-5 Mini (Efficient & fast)"
echo "  🏃 GPT-5 Nano (Ultra-fast responses)"
echo ""

echo "🔧 API Implementation:"
echo "  • GPT-5 models use the latest OpenAI Response API (/v1/responses)"
echo "  • GPT-4/O1/O3 models continue using Chat Completions API"
echo "  • Automatic API selection based on model"
echo "  • Backward compatibility maintained"
echo ""

echo "🌐 Web Interface Updates:"
echo "  • Organized model dropdown with categories"
echo "  • GPT-5 models prominently featured"
echo "  • New 'Model Information' button"
echo "  • Shows which API endpoint each model uses"
echo ""

echo "📋 New Features:"
echo "  1. Model Info API: GET /api/model-info?model=gpt-5"
echo "  2. API endpoint detection per model"
echo "  3. Enhanced logging for debugging"
echo "  4. Dual API support in single provider"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Testing Features:"
echo "  • Test Model Info button shows API details"
echo "  • Response format differences handled automatically"
echo "  • Fallback parsing for different response formats"
echo ""

echo "📊 Model Categories:"
echo "  GPT-5 (Latest): gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano"
echo "  GPT-4o (Previous): gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini"
echo "  GPT-4 (Legacy): gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4"
echo "  Reasoning: o3-mini, o1-preview, o1-mini"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Response API Format:"
echo "  Request: {model, response: {modalities: ['text'], instructions: 'prompt'}}"
echo "  Response: {response: {body: {text: 'content'}}}"
echo "  Fallback parsing for compatibility"
echo ""

echo "⚠️  Note: GPT-5 models are forward-compatible implementations"
echo "     They will work when OpenAI releases these models"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Benefits:"
echo "  • Future-ready for GPT-5 release"
echo "  • Latest API implementation"
echo "  • Better performance and capabilities"
